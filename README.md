# scratch
Scratch to try out phantomjs.
Followed installation recipe at http://jonnnnyw.github.io/php-phantomjs/installation.html
Followed basic usage recipe at http://jonnnnyw.github.io/php-phantomjs/usage.html
But composer's autoload doesn't seem to be working as I want it: PHP Fatal error:  Class 'JonnyW\PhantomJs\Client' not found in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/scratch/scratch.php on line 10
